## A

**Accelerated Time**  
A localized space condition wherein natural processes occur at vastly compressed temporal rates through Master Physical Controller operations. During the tomb dissolution, this process maintained natural law while compressing geological timescales into moments.

> "We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization; we merely wish to invoke the process of accelerated time" (189:2.1). "The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated, hastened to that point where it became well-nigh instantaneous" (189:2.8).

**Antigravity Behavior**  
The condition achieved when ultimatonic revolutionary velocity accelerates to partially resist linear gravity while remaining responsive to Paradise gravity.

> "Ultimatons are capable of accelerating revolutionary velocity to the point of partial antigravity behavior, but they cannot, independent of force organizers or power directors, attain the critical escape velocity of deindividuation, return to the puissant-energy stage" (42:6.3). "Ultimatons have three varieties of motion: mutual resistance to cosmic force, individual revolutions of antigravity potential, and the intraelectronic positions of the one hundred mutually interassociated ultimatons" (42:6.4).

**Archangel (Chief of)**  
The senior administrator of the angels of the resurrection who requested custody of Jesus' mortal remains for dissolution through accelerated time.

> At 3:10 AM, "the chief of archangels—the angels of the resurrection—approached Gabriel and asked for the mortal body of Jesus. Said the chief of the archangels: 'We may not participate in the morontia resurrection of the bestowal experience of Michael our sovereign, but we would have his mortal remains put in our custody for immediate dissolution'" (189:2.1). "After the chief of archangels had been granted this request, he summoned to his assistance many of his fellows, together with a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities" (189:2.3).

**Archangel Circuit**  
The communication system connecting Urantia to universe administration, first operated from this world seventy-five minutes after the dissolution.

> "The circuit of the archangels then operated for the first time from Urantia. Gabriel and the archangel hosts moved to the place of the spiritual polarity of the planet; and when Gabriel gave the signal, there flashed to the first of the system mansion worlds the voice of Gabriel, saying: 'By the mandate of Michael, let the dead of a Urantia dispensation rise!'" (189:3.2).

**Associate Power Directors**  
Administrative coordinators for all orders of Master Physical Controllers, serving as mobile subordinates of the Supreme Power Centers.

> "These marvelously efficient beings are intrusted with the assignment and dispatch of all orders of the Master Physical Controllers in accordance with the ever-shifting needs of the constantly changing energy status of the realms" (29:4.15). Three million associate power directors serve in each minor sector of Orvonton, dispatching physical controllers to systems and individual planets as needed.

---

## B

**Burial Cloths**  
The linen wrappings and bandages that contained Jesus' body during burial and remained undisturbed after the dissolution.

> "In the recess of stone where they had laid Jesus, Mary saw only the folded napkin where his head had rested and the bandages wherewith he had been wrapped lying intact and as they had rested on the stone before the celestial hosts removed the body. The covering sheet lay at the foot of the burial niche" (189:4.6). The preservation of these cloths in their original position provided testimony that the body had not been physically removed but had undergone dissolution within the wrappings.

---

## C

**Celestial Personalities**  
The assembled universe beings who witnessed and participated in the tomb operations, representing all orders of cosmic intelligence.

> "After the chief of archangels had been granted this request, he summoned to his assistance many of his fellows, together with a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities" (189:2.3). Each order contributed specialized capabilities to accomplish the unprecedented dissolution through accelerated time.

**Chronoldeks**  
Specialized frandalanks that register time in addition to energy presence, providing temporal monitoring capabilities for universe operations.

> "The frandalanks that register time in addition to quantitative and qualitative energy presence are called chronoldeks" (29:4.37). These living instruments would have monitored temporal parameters during the dissolution, tracking both normal time-space and the accelerated time within the tomb chamber.

**Creator Son**  
A Paradise order of divine sonship with inherent power to bestow themselves in the likeness of created beings and to resurrect by their own authority.

> "A Creator Son has within himself the power to bestow himself in the likeness of any of his created sons; he has within himself the power to lay down his observable life and to take it up again" (189:0.2). This authority derives directly from the Paradise Father's command and enabled Jesus to achieve morontia resurrection at 3:02 AM through his own Creator prerogatives, independent of celestial assistance.

---

## D

**Deindividuation**  
The process whereby ultimatons return to their pre-material energy state when accelerated beyond critical escape velocity.

> "Ultimatons are capable of accelerating revolutionary velocity to the point of partial antigravity behavior, but they cannot, independent of force organizers or power directors, attain the critical escape velocity of deindividuation, return to the puissant-energy stage" (42:6.3). During the tomb dissolution, Master Physical Controllers enabled ultimatons to achieve this critical velocity, converting material atoms back to puissant energy.

**Dematerialization (Technique of)**  
A celestial method for matter-to-energy conversion that bypasses natural decomposition processes.

> The archangels possess a technique of dematerialization which they chose not to employ at the tomb. The archangel chief stated: "We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization; we merely wish to invoke the process of accelerated time" (189:2.1). Dematerialization bypasses natural decomposition entirely, while accelerated time—their chosen method—maintains natural decomposition but compresses temporal duration.

---

## E

**Elemental Disintegration**  
The natural process of material decomposition wherein complex structures break down into constituent elements and fundamental particles.

> "The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated" (189:2.8). The accelerated time process maintained this natural sequence while compressing billions of years of decomposition into moments.

**Energy Transmitters**  
Master Physical Controllers who serve as living conductors and dispatchers of energy throughout planetary and system circuits.

> Energy Transmitters are described as "marvelous dispatchers of energy as it is manifested on the individual worlds" (29:4.27). During the tomb dissolution, these beings would have managed the massive energy release, directing it safely through established circuits or storing it for specific purposes.

---

## F

**Frandalanks**  
Living mechanisms created to serve as automatic presence, pressure, and velocity gauges for all forms of universe force-energy.

> "The frandalanks are created in thirty divisions, one for each form of basic universe force, and they function exclusively as living and automatic presence, pressure, and velocity gauges" (29:4.37). These beings would have established baseline measurements across all thirty forms of universe energy present during the dissolution operation.

---

## G

**Gabriel**  
The Bright and Morning Star of Nebadon, chief executive of the local universe who authorized the dissolution of Jesus' mortal remains.

> "And when Gabriel had conferred with the senior Most High of Edentia, the archangel spokesman for the celestial hosts was given permission to make such disposition of the physical remains of Jesus as he might determine" (189:2.2). Gabriel's authorization transferred custody from Joseph of Arimathea to the archangels for the dissolution operation.

**Golgotha**  
The site of crucifixion located just north of Jerusalem where Jesus died at 3:00 PM on Friday, April 7, AD 30.

> The burial procession departed Golgotha at approximately 4:30 PM, proceeding to Joseph's tomb "located a short distance north of Golgotha and across the road leading to Samaria" (188:1.2). The proximity of tomb to crucifixion site enabled the rapid burial required before Sabbath began.

---

## J

**Joseph of Arimathea**  
A wealthy member of the Sanhedrin who requested Jesus' body from Pilate and provided his new family tomb for the burial.

> Joseph "quickly signed the order which authorized Joseph to proceed to Golgotha and take immediate and full possession of the Master's body" (188:0.3). Joseph believed Jesus would rise from the dead and considered his new tomb an appropriate resting place for the Master.

**Joseph's Tomb**  
The new rock-hewn sepulcher in Joseph's garden where Jesus' body was laid and where the dissolution occurred.

> "Joseph's new family tomb, hewn out of solid rock, located a short distance north of Golgotha and across the road leading to Samaria. No one had ever lain in this tomb" (188:1.2). The chamber measured approximately ten feet square and faced eastward, allowing dawn light to illuminate the interior.

---

## M

**Master Physical Controllers**  
The mobile subordinates of Supreme Power Centers who direct energy operations at planetary and system levels through seven specialized orders.

> "These beings are the mobile subordinates of the Supreme Power Centers...endowed with capabilities of individuality metamorphosis of such a nature that they can engage in a remarkable variety of autotransport" (29:4.1). Seven distinct orders coordinated during the tomb dissolution to accelerate ultimatonic revolutionary velocities and manage the resulting energy transformations.

**Mechanical Controllers**  
The most powerful Master Physical Controllers stationed on inhabited worlds, possessing supreme antigravity endowment exceeding all other beings.

> "Of all the Master Physical Controllers assigned to the inhabited worlds, the mechanical controllers are by far the most powerful. Possessing the living endowment of antigravity in excess of all other beings" (29:4.19). Ten mechanical controllers serve on Urantia, normally facilitating seraphic transport; during the tomb operation, they would have initiated the critical antigravity effects necessary for temporal acceleration.

**Midwayers (United)**  
Permanent planetary citizens who bridge material and spiritual realms, capable of manipulating physical matter while remaining normally invisible to mortals.

> "Then, with the aid of the Urantia midwayers, proceeded to take possession of Jesus' physical body" (189:2.3). The midwayers rolled away the stone from the tomb entrance by mandate, enabling the celestial hosts to remove the physical body for dissolution.

**Morontia**  
The transitional reality level between material and spiritual existence, the form Jesus achieved through resurrection at 3:02 AM.

> "At two minutes past three o'clock, this Sunday morning, April 9, A.D. 30, the resurrected morontia form and personality of Jesus of Nazareth came forth from the tomb" (189:1.1). The morontia form could pass through sealed chambers and later be made visible to human observers through transformer ministry.

**Most High of Edentia**  
The constellation executive whom Gabriel consulted before authorizing the tomb dissolution operation.

> "And when Gabriel had conferred with the senior Most High of Edentia, the archangel spokesman for the celestial hosts was given permission to make such disposition of the physical remains of Jesus as he might determine" (189:2.2). The Most Highs coordinate constellation circuits essential for universe administration, including archangel circuits.

---

## N

**Nicodemus**  
A wealthy Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin who assisted Joseph in preparing Jesus' body for burial with large quantities of myrrh and aloes.

> Joseph and Nicodemus "had brought with them large quantities of myrrh and aloes, and they now wrapped the body with bandages saturated with these solutions" (188:1.4). Like Joseph, Nicodemus became one of the most outspoken disciples of Jesus in Jerusalem following the crucifixion.

---

## P

**Paradise Personalities**  
Seven unidentified beings from Paradise who arrived at 2:45 AM Sunday and deployed themselves around the tomb to witness Jesus' resurrection.

> "At two forty-five Sunday morning, the Paradise incarnation commission, consisting of seven unidentified Paradise personalities, arrived on the scene and immediately deployed themselves about the tomb" (189:1.1). These beings witnessed the morontia resurrection and immediately signaled their intention to depart for Uversa after Jesus emerged.

**Personalized Adjuster**  
The former Thought Adjuster of Jesus who, having achieved personalization, temporarily directed the assembled celestial hosts during the resurrection events.

> The Personalized Adjuster, "being in personal command of the assembled celestial hosts then on Urantia," declared that no creature could assist in Jesus' resurrection since he possessed inherent Creator power to resurrect himself (189:0.2). This same Adjuster had indwelt Jesus throughout his mortal life until separation at death.

**Pilate**  
The Roman procurator of Judea who authorized Joseph of Arimathea to take possession of Jesus' body following crucifixion.

> "When he heard the request, he quickly signed the order which authorized Joseph to proceed to Golgotha and take immediate and full possession of the Master's body" (188:0.3). Pilate refused Joseph's offer of payment and granted full custody of the remains.

**Primary Associators**  
Master Physical Controllers described as masterly energy conservators who manipulate basic forms of physical energy.

> Primary Associators are "those exceedingly interesting and invaluable beings who are such masterly energy conservators and custodians" (29:4.32). During the tomb dissolution, these beings would have conserved and stored the massive energy release from matter-energy conversion.

**Puissant Energy**  
The first stage of emergent energy, characterized as powerful-directional, mass-movemented, and mighty-tensioned force.

> This "mighty-tensioned, and forcible-reacting energy" represents "gigantic energy systems set in motion by the activities of the primary force organizers" (42:2.11). Ultimatons "cannot, independent of force organizers or power directors, attain the critical escape velocity of deindividuation, return to the puissant-energy stage" (42:6.3). During the dissolution, Master Physical Controllers enabled ultimatons to achieve this return to pure energy state.

---

## S

**Secondary Dissociators**  
Master Physical Controllers of enormous antigravity endowment, designated as "the alchemists of space and the wonder-workers of time."

> "These beings of enormous antigravity endowment are the reverse workers...They are truly the alchemists of space and the wonder-workers of time" (29:4.35). Their designation as time wonder-workers directly correlates with accelerated time operations; during the tomb dissolution, they would have facilitated the final ultimatonic transitions to puissant energy.

**Shroud of Turin**  
Physical artifact exhibiting image and blood evidence corresponding to wounds and burial configuration described in the Urantia Papers.

> The Shroud exhibits characteristics consistent with brief electromagnetic radiation exposure during dissolution: surface oxidation limited to 200 nanometers depth, three-dimensional body contour encoding, and blood evidence corresponding to crucifixion wounds. Whether this constitutes the actual burial cloth remains scientifically undetermined, though forensic correspondence between revealed text and measurable evidence merits systematic investigation.

**Supreme Power Centers**  
Billions of specialized beings functioning as living switching stations that regulate physical energy throughout the grand universe.

> Origin: Created by the Seven Supreme Power Directors in association with the Seven Master Spirits (29:2.1).

> These beings "are endowed with Third-Source personality and disclose unquestioned volitional capacity of a high order" (29:2.9), serving as "the intellect of the power system of the grand universe." They function in seven specialized groups from Havona Centers down to System Centers. While Supreme Power Centers did not directly participate in tomb operations, their subordinates—the Master Physical Controllers—executed the dissolution under established cosmic protocols.

---

## U

**Ultimatons**  
The fundamental particles of physical creation; the first measurable form of energy.

> "The ultimaton, the first measurable form of energy, has Paradise as its nucleus" (42:1.2). These particles exhibit three varieties of motion: "mutual resistance to cosmic force, individual revolutions of antigravity potential, and the intraelectronic positions of the one hundred mutually interassociated ultimatons" (42:6.4)—meaning their positional relationships when organized into material particles. One hundred ultimatons comprise an electron through mutual attraction (42:6.5). During dissolution, Master Physical Controllers accelerated ultimaton revolutionary velocities toward critical escape thresholds where matter transforms to energy.

**Ultimatonic Revolutionary Velocity**  
The axial spin rate of ultimatons that determines their energy state, gravitational response, and material properties.

> "This same ultimatonic velocity of axial revolution also determines the negative or positive reactions of the several types of electronic units" (42:6.6). Master Physical Controllers can synchronize acceleration of these velocities across countless ultimatons, enabling transitions between matter, energy, and approaching deindividuation.

**Universe Administration**  
The hierarchical organization managing cosmic operations through coordinated action of specialized celestial beings.

> The tomb dissolution demonstrated this administration through clear sequence: the archangel chief's request (189:2.1), Gabriel's consultation with the Most High of Edentia (189:2.2), authorization granted, and coordinated execution by assembled celestial orders (189:2.3). This sequence reveals ordered government achieving divine purposes through natural law.

---

## W

**Wave Energy**  
The spectrum of force-energy manifestations organized into one hundred octaves, from ultimatonic frequencies through electromagnetic radiation to gravita.

> Paper 42 describes these "one hundred octaves of wave energy" (42:5.9), with visible light occupying octave 46 and ultraviolet radiation at octave 47. During dissolution, accelerating ultimatons would progress through successive octaves as revolutionary velocities increased, emitting electromagnetic radiation across multiple octaves.
