**Havona and the Twenty Chairs (an allegory)**

Seven long tables ran parallel to each other in a science classroom. Each needed seating on only one side of the table. We had just twenty chairs, but Professor Occam instructed us to distribute them proportionally among the tables, then he left before we could ask him for one more chair to make it an even twenty-one.

One athletic student crammed all twenty chairs at the middle table, but we convinced him that the chair count for any of the tables needed to be upwards of zero. After much pacing and several pots of coffee, we came up with two plausible, proportionate distributions, agreeing that there could be others.

Pattern A: 2 4 2 4 2 4 2  
Pattern B: 1 3 4 4 4 3 1

A is more social, but B is better for people who don't want to sit beside anybody.

Scientifically, Pattern A is oscillating and sine-wavey. Pattern B is Gaussian-like and bell-curvy.

Somebody texted the professor about the patterns. Occam texted back a single word: **Havona**. Luckily, Bill, a revelation major, knew what Havona was. He looked up the seven circuits of the Havona worlds and found a quote:

"The billion worlds of Havona are arranged in seven concentric circuits immediately surrounding the three circuits of Paradise satellites. There are upwards of thirty-five million worlds in the innermost Havona circuit and over two hundred and forty-five million in the outermost, with proportionate numbers intervening." 14:1.9

Bill said, "If we can figure out the number of worlds on each circuit, we'll know how to place the chairs."

He calculated a base world number for each circuit, starting with the innermost, which he set at 35 million. Then he distributed the worlds, 35 million at a time, in arithmetical progression, out to the seventh circuit, which received 245 million worlds. But that only added up to 980 million. We needed a billion worlds exactly! We had 20 million left to divvy up.

"There it is!" Bill exclaimed. "It's just like the twenty chairs!"

Using his Texas Instruments calculator, he punched in numbers and wrote…

**Pattern A**  
Circuit 1: 35 + 2 = 37 M  
Circuit 2: 70 + 4 = 74 M  
Circuit 3: 105 + 2 = 107 M  
Circuit 4: 140 + 4 = 144 M  
Circuit 5: 175 + 2 = 177 M  
Circuit 6: 210 + 4 = 214 M  
Circuit 7: 245 + 2 = 247 M

**Pattern B**  
Circuit 1: 35 + 1 = 36 M  
Circuit 2: 70 + 3 = 73 M  
Circuit 3: 105 + 4 = 109 M  
Circuit 4: 140 + 4 = 144 M  
Circuit 5: 175 + 4 = 179 M  
Circuit 6: 210 + 3 = 213 M  
Circuit 7: 245 + 1 = 246 M

"Both patterns total to a billion!"

Bill felt pleased with himself until we asked which one it was: Pattern A or B? So, Bill continued figuring.

“Havona serves as the pattern creation for all other universes. So, how are the other universes arranged? If we figure that out, then we can reverse-engineer Havona. For the superuniverse level, they say…"

**The local universes are in closer proximity as they approach Havona; the circuits are greater in number, and there is increased superimposition, layer upon layer. But farther out from the eternal center…**

"Where *we* are," Bill interjected.

**…there are fewer and fewer systems, layers, circuits, and universes.** (15:3.16)

"And then there's the first outer space level where they say…"

**But about one-half million light-years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe…**

"Where *we* are," He interjected.

**…we observe the beginnings of a zone of an unbelievable energy action which increases in volume and intensity for over twenty-five million light-years**. (12:1.14)

Bill goes, "From the superuniverse edge, things get denser and denser approaching inward toward the maximum kernel. And going outward from the first outer space level's inner edge, things get increasingly intense before reaching the level's maximum kernel. Presumably, the intensity decreases as it approaches its outermost edge. That sounds Gaussian-like to me. Bell-curvy. Havona must resemble Pattern B! The Gaussian-like Havona is the definitive pattern for the universe of universes... probably.”

Excitedly, Bill called Professor Occam with the breathtaking news about the chair and table arrangement. However, the professor sounded annoyed. He said he meant to text Havana, not Havona. He likes antique cars and a simple life, so he's packed and on his way to Cuba. He advised us to arrange the twenty chairs, sit on them, then put our heads on the seven tables until he returns.
