Avoid ~TIME. revealed times below. Unless the book says like: The women arrived around 4:30, then this can be placed below as ~4:30. Other events are on the diagonals above the line at untimed tickmarks.

Diagonals should be selected major events, and stated with one or two words. Place multiple words on dual diagonals that highlight together. Other events might have Text Box datw without their own ticks. The main event tick stays lit.

~2:47 AM - "Vibrations Begin" - Leave untimed, but highlighted as a major event after 2:45 that stays lit. This is the pattern.

6. 3:10 AM - "Archangel's Request" - Good
7. 3:10-3:15 AM - "Dissolution" - drop -3:15. Keep 3:10 lit, light Dissolution diagonal
8. ~3:20 AM - "Stone Removed" - drop ~3:20 AM. Keep 3:10 lit, light Stone Removed.
9. 3:30 AM - "Women Approach" ~3:30 AM

The initial Narrative timeline can have the events prior to Sunday ending at 2:45 with the Paradise beings arrival. Then Then a break showing the Tomb Ops link and the Shroud Image link, no time scale related to these on this initial timeline. Then after Shroud image link, the timeline continues from Mary's discovery of the empty tomb ~3:30, her discussion with the gardener/Morontia Jesus, no time. And then 4:30 (or around 4:30). for the Dispensational Resurrection. Then an untimed link to the conclusion.

After, we can talk about MPC IG.
