Hi David,  
Yes, indeed\! If you download the HTML version of the text from here:

You can see a three-letter style code that is applied to paragraphs:

This indicates what size of a gap should occur _after_ the paragraph that is being styled:

- _btn_: **n**o gap. A normal amount of space between this paragraph and the next paragraph.
- _bts_: **s**mall gap occurs at the end of this paragraph and before the next paragraph.
- _btl_: **l**arge gap occurs at the end of this paragraph and before the next paragraph.
- _bte_: **e**xtra large gap. Used to set authorship bylines at the ends of a paper off from the text. Also used once in paper 98, and three times in Paper 106\.

There are also special stylings for Paper 30's lists of lists, and poems/prayers found in a few papers (e.g., Anna's poem at Jesus' birth).

Good luck with your formatting endeavor\! I've been turning over a similar idea in my personal endeavors. Here's some food for thought for you I might volunteer as you pursue this work:

1. Often in a paper there will be 1 to 3 paragraphs set off by _bts_ or _btl_ paragraph gaps. Sometimes these set-off paragraphs feel _very much_ to me like a "sidebar" or "inset box" or "aside" you might find in an academic textbook. For example, 13:4.4-5 really feels like the authors step aside for a moment to reflect on the topic of "Physical reactions, spiritual reactions, and free will". I've wondered what the reading experience would be like if these were actually pulled off into inset boxes. This would be a major interpretive effort, of course, but since the English text is public domain, anyone is free to try such things. Hopefully with careful consideration and reflection.
2. Some lists really just seem to be "tables." For example, 15:2 has lists with .......dots.... in them. These really just seem like they could be formatted as HTML tables and be just as informative, if not moreso. This definitely feels like something the 1950s typesetter did to save costs instead of laying out special, bordered tables. That's just my personal pet theory, of course.
3. Sometimes the end of a paragraph coincides with the end of a printed page in the original 1955 printing. Technically, there might be a small or large gap at the end of this paragraph, but since it coincides with a page break there's no way to tell. Officially, Urantia Foundation has decided to code all of these situations as _btn_ (no special paragraph gap). But someone could look at each of these and make an interpretive judgment call, based on the context of the material.
