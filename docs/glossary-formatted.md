# Glossary - Accelerated Time of the Tomb

*Terms marked with (H) indicate analytical hypotheses extending beyond explicit revelatory text*

---

## A

**Accelerated Time**  
A localized space condition instituted by authorized beings using Master Physical Controllers wherein natural processes occur at vastly compressed temporal rates.

> The archangel chief's request was specific: "We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization; we merely wish to invoke the process of accelerated time" (189:2.1). The mortal remains experienced "the same natural process of elemental disintegration...except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated" (189:2.8).

**Antigravity Behavior**  
The condition achieved when ultimatonic revolutionary velocity is accelerated to partially resist linear gravity while remaining responsive to Paradise gravity.

> "Ultimatons are capable of accelerating revolutionary velocity to the point of partial antigravity behavior" (42:6.3). These fundamental particles possess "individual revolutions of antigravity potential" (42:6.4) that, when accelerated by Master Physical Controllers, enable resistance to local gravitational forces without achieving complete escape velocity.

**Antigravity Endowment**  
The inherent capacity of certain celestial beings to resist or neutralize gravitational forces.

> Mechanical Controllers possess "living endowment of antigravity in excess of all other beings" (29:4.19). Secondary Dissociators demonstrate "enormous antigravity endowment" (29:4.35). This endowment enables Master Physical Controllers to manipulate gravity-responsive energies and facilitate seraphic transport through space.

**(H) Antigravity Fields**  
Zones of gravitational resistance generated when Master Physical Controllers coordinate ultimatonic revolutionary velocities across material structures.

> While the revelation describes "antigravity behavior" (42:6.3) and "antigravity endowment" (29:4.19), the field concept represents analytical correlation about collective effects when countless ultimatons achieve partial antigravity simultaneously. Such fields theoretically enable localized temporal acceleration by creating void-like conditions within normal spacetime.

**Archangels (Chief of)**  
The senior administrator of the angels of the resurrection who requested custody of Jesus's mortal remains.

> At 3:10 AM, this chief approached Gabriel stating his intention to invoke accelerated time rather than dematerialization (189:2.1). Following authorization, he "summoned to his assistance many of his fellows, together with a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities" (189:2.3) to accomplish the dissolution.

**Associate Power Directors**  
Administrative coordinators for all orders of Master Physical Controllers, serving as mobile subordinates of the Supreme Power Centers.

> "The associate power directors are the loyal assistants of the Supreme Power Centers, functioning in all seven divisions of the grand universe" (29:4.15). Three million are assigned per minor sector of Orvonton, alternating between executive service and inspection duties while maintaining vast reserves of controllers on minor sector headquarters worlds.

**(H) Authorization Protocols**  
The administrative chain of command required for extraordinary celestial operations, as demonstrated in the tomb dissolution.

> While not explicitly termed in the revelation, the sequence is clear: the archangel chief requested permission from Gabriel, who "conferred with the senior Most High of Edentia" before granting authorization (189:2.2). This hierarchical approval process ensures universe operations align with divine administration even during unprecedented events.

---

## B

**Burial Cloths/Bandages**  
The linen wrappings that contained Jesus's body and preserved evidence of the dissolution event.

> "When Mary and the others entered the tomb, they found the body gone but the grave cloths undisturbed" (189:4.6). The bandages remained "just as they had rested on the stone shelf before the celestial hosts removed the body" (189:4.6), creating material testimony to the controlled nature of the dissolution rather than physical removal.

---

## C

**Celestial Hosts/Personalities**  
The assembled universe beings who witnessed and participated in the resurrection events.

> The archangel chief gathered these beings with a specific purpose: "summoned to his assistance many of his fellows, together with a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities" (189:2.3). These hosts would be "spared the memory of enduring the sight of the slow decay of the human form of the Creator and Upholder of a universe" (189:2.1) through the accelerated dissolution. Each order contributed specialized capabilities to this unprecedented operation.

**Chronoldeks**  
Specialized frandalanks that register time in addition to energy presence, providing temporal monitoring during universe operations.

> "The frandalanks that register time in addition to quantitative and qualitative energy presence are called chronoldeks" (29:4.37). During the tomb dissolution, these beings would have monitored the temporal differential between the accelerated field and normal spacetime, enabling coordination between radically different time rates.

**(H) Consciousness-Directed Operations**  
The process whereby intelligent beings control physical energy through thought rather than mechanical manipulation.

> While not explicitly termed, the principle emerges from revealed patterns: "Mind universally dominates matter" (42:12.14). Master Physical Controllers demonstrate this principle continuously, directing ultimatons through consciousness fields rather than physical force, achieving energy control through mental resonance with fundamental frequencies.

**(H) Controlled Dissolution**  
The orchestrated conversion of material body to energy through temporal acceleration while maintaining complete process management.

> This concept emerges from correlating the "near-instantaneous dissolution" (189:2.1) with Master Physical Controller capabilities for energy management. The operation required precise control at every phase—monitoring, acceleration, conversion, and distribution—preventing catastrophic energy release while achieving complete matter transformation.

**Council of Equilibrium**  
The high commissioners of power who direct Master Physical Controllers throughout the superuniverses.

> "From here they are directed and distributed by the Council of Equilibrium, the high commissioners of power dispatched by the Seven Master Spirits" (29:4.2). This council interprets frandalank readings and coordinates controller assignments, ensuring balanced energy management across cosmic operations.

**Creator Son Prerogatives**  
The inherent powers of universe sovereignty that enabled Jesus to resurrect himself.

> "When Jesus came forth from the tomb, it was by virtue of his own inherent power; he had no assistance" (189:0.1). These prerogatives allowed him to achieve morontia resurrection independently at 3:02 AM, twelve minutes before the body dissolution began at 3:14 AM.

**Critical Escape Velocity**  
The ultimatonic revolutionary speed at which particles achieve deindividuation and return to puissant energy.

> Ultimatons can accelerate "to the point of partial antigravity behavior, but they cannot, independent of force organizers or power directors, attain the critical escape velocity of deindividuation" (42:6.3). This velocity threshold, normally achieved only in dying suns, was reached locally through Master Physical Controller operations.

---

## D

**Deindividuation**  
The process whereby ultimatons return to their pre-material energy state when accelerated beyond critical revolutionary velocity.

> "Ultimatons, unknown on Urantia, slow down through many phases of physical activity before they attain the revolutionary-energy prerequisites to electronic organization" (42:6.4). Deindividuation reverses this process through acceleration rather than deceleration. During tomb dissolution, deindividuation converted material atoms back to puissant energy through accelerated revolutionary velocities, enabling matter's return to pre-electronic energy states.

**Dematerialization**  
The complete conversion of material substance into energy through established celestial techniques.

> The archangel chief explicitly distinguished this from their chosen method: "We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization; we merely wish to invoke the process of accelerated time" (189:2.1). Dematerialization represents instantaneous matter-to-energy conversion, as demonstrated when Melchizedek "vanished from the sight of his human associates" (93:9.1) after his mission completion.

**Differential Electronic Dimensions**  
The varying energy states and orbital configurations within atomic structures that determine material properties.

> "The ultimatonic axial revolutionary velocities...determine the differential electronic dimensions" (42:6.6). These dimensional variations enable Master Physical Controllers to manipulate matter at sub-atomic levels, selectively accelerating specific atomic components while preserving others, as evidenced by preserved blood traces on burial shrouds despite complete tissue dissolution.

**(H) Dissolution Event**  
The coordinated five-minute operation between 3:10-3:15 AM wherein Master Physical Controllers achieved near-instantaneous conversion of Jesus's physical body to energy.

> While not explicitly termed in revealed text, the evidence pattern indicates a precisely orchestrated sequence: temporal field establishment, ultimaton acceleration, matter-energy conversion, and controlled energy distribution. The event required representatives from all celestial orders working in unprecedented coordination.

---

## E

**(H) Electromagnetic Discharge**  
The controlled release of electromagnetic radiation at the temporal field boundary during the dissolution process.

> While the revelation doesn't explicitly describe electromagnetic effects, the analytical pattern emerges from correlating Master Physical Controller capabilities with observable phenomena. Energy Transformers' ability to "exude or liberate energy" (29:4.24) combined with temporal acceleration would generate electromagnetic signatures at the interface between accelerated and normal time zones.

**(H) Electromagnetic Documentation**  
The deliberate preservation of electromagnetic signatures as permanent evidence of the dissolution event.

> The hypothesis suggests Master Physical Controllers intentionally modulated electromagnetic discharge to create lasting testimony. This aligns with Energy Transformers' precision control capabilities and the revelation's emphasis on preserving evidence of material death even for the Creator Son.

**Elemental Disintegration**  
The natural process of bodily decomposition accelerated to near-instantaneous completion.

> "The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated" (189:2.8). This process honors the universal mandate of dust-to-dust while compressing geological timescales into moments.

**Energy Circuits (Planetary)**  
The established pathways through which energy flows within and around inhabited worlds.

> Energy Transmitters serve as "marvelous dispatchers of energy as it is manifested on the individual worlds" (29:4.27). During the dissolution, these circuits received and distributed the converted energy from Jesus's body, safely managing approximately 1.5 billion megatons TNT equivalent without catastrophic release.

**Energy Transformers**  
Living beings who serve as conscious energy switches and transmutation specialists.

> "These transformers are powerful and effective living switches, being able to dispose themselves for or against a given power disposition or directionization" (29:4.24). Almost one million function in Satania alone. During tomb operations, Energy Transformers modulated energy release from matter conversion while maintaining "universal energy balance, or power equilibrium."

**Energy Transmitters**  
Celestial beings who dispatch and channel energy along specific pathways.

> When energy needs redirection, "the transmitters deploy themselves in a line along the desired energy path, and by virtue of their unique attributes of energy-attraction, they can actually induce an increased energy flow in the desired direction" (29:4.28). These controllers channeled the converted energy from dissolution through planetary circuits.

---

## F

**Frandalanks**  
Living energy measurement instruments created jointly by all three orders of energy-control beings.

> "The frandalanks are created in thirty divisions, one for each form of basic universe force, and they function exclusively as living and automatic presence, pressure, and velocity gauges" (29:4.37). During the tomb dissolution, frandalanks monitored all thirty forms of universe energy present, tracking the transformation from material to puissant energy states.

---

## G

**Gabriel (Chief Executive of Nebadon)**  
The first-born and chief executive of all universe personalities in Nebadon, present at the tomb to authorize the dissolution operation.

> "Gabriel is the chief executive of the universe of Nebadon and the arbiter of all executive appeals respecting its administration" (33:4.5). When approached by the archangel chief, Gabriel "conferred with the senior Most High of Edentia and then...granted the request of the archangels" (189:2.2), establishing protocol for unprecedented cosmic situations.

---

## H

**(H) Harmonic Resonance**  
The synchronized frequency patterns created when multiple Master Physical Controllers operate in coordinated formation.

> This concept emerges from observing collective controller operations where "ten of these controllers act in unison" for seraphic transport (29:4.19). The pattern suggests consciousness fields achieving resonance with ultimatonic frequencies, enabling precise energy control through harmonic amplification.

---

## I

**Immediate Dissolution**  
The rapid conversion of physical remains to energy within moments of authorization.

> The process was described as "well-nigh instantaneous" (189:2.8), indicating measurable but extremely brief duration. This immediacy distinguishes the tomb event from both natural decomposition and standard dematerialization techniques.

---

## J

**Joseph's Tomb**  
The new rock-hewn sepulchre where Jesus's body was laid and where the dissolution occurred.

> "Joseph's new tomb, wherein no man had yet been laid" (188:1.2) provided the setting for these unprecedented events. The tomb's specific characteristics—its newness, location, and construction—created the physical framework for both resurrection and dissolution operations.

---

## L

**Living Endowment**  
The inherent life-force characteristics that enable certain beings to manipulate energy and gravity.

> Mechanical Controllers possess "living endowment of antigravity in excess of all other beings" (29:4.19). This endowment represents not acquired ability but inherent capacity, built into their very nature at creation.

**Localized Space Condition**  
A region where normal spacetime parameters are modified for specific operational purposes.

> The accelerated time field represents such a condition—a bounded area where "natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated" (189:2.8) without affecting surrounding space. This localization prevented universe-wide disruption while achieving operational objectives.

---

## M

**Master Physical Controllers**  
The mobile subordinates of Supreme Power Centers who direct energy at planetary and system levels.

> "These beings are the mobile subordinates of the Supreme Power Centers...endowed with capabilities of individuality metamorphosis of such a nature that they can engage in a remarkable variety of autotransport" (29:4.1). Seven distinct orders serve throughout the grand universe, coordinating during the tomb dissolution to accelerate ultimaton revolutionary velocities.

**Mechanical Controllers**  
The most powerful Master Physical Controllers stationed on inhabited worlds, possessing supreme antigravity endowment.

> "Of all the Master Physical Controllers assigned to the inhabited worlds, the mechanical controllers are by far the most powerful" (29:4.19). Ten serve on Urantia, normally facilitating seraphic transport. During tomb operations, they accelerated ultimaton velocities to create antigravity conditions necessary for temporal acceleration.

**Midwayers (Secondary/United)**  
Permanent citizens of Urantia who bridge material and spiritual realms, capable of physical manipulation while remaining normally invisible.

> The united midwayers participated directly: "with the aid of the Urantia midwayers, proceeded to take possession of Jesus' physical body" (189:2.3). They rolled away the tomb stones, causing guards to observe "this huge stone begin to roll away from the entrance of the tomb, apparently of its own accord" (189:2.4).

**Mind-Energy Manipulation**  
The fundamental process whereby consciousness directs physical energy through thought-frequency modulation.

> "Mind universally dominates matter, even as it is in turn responsive to the ultimate overcontrol of spirit" (42:12.14). Master Physical Controllers exemplify this principle continuously, achieving precise control through mental direction rather than mechanical manipulation.

**Morontia Auxiliary Personalities**  
Specialized beings who facilitate transitions between material and spiritual states.

> "By the aid of certain morontia auxiliary personalities, the morontia form can be made at one time as of the spirit so that it can become indifferent to ordinary matter" (189:2.3). These personalities enabled Jesus's morontia form to remain invisible during dissolution operations.

**Morontia Form/Resurrection**  
The transitional state between material and spiritual existence that Jesus achieved through Creator Son prerogatives.

> "At two minutes past three o'clock...the resurrected morontia form and personality of Jesus of Nazareth came forth from the tomb" (189:1.1). This form exists independent of physical matter, demonstrated by Jesus's emergence twelve minutes before body dissolution began.

**Most High of Edentia**  
The senior constellation administrator present during the resurrection events who authorized the accelerated dissolution.

> Gabriel "conferred with the senior Most High of Edentia" before granting the archangels' request (189:2.2). This Most High's presence on Urantia during the resurrection indicates constellation-level involvement in these unprecedented events.

---

## N

**Natural Law Compliance**  
The fundamental principle that no universe operations, however extraordinary, violate established physical laws.

> The tomb dissolution exemplified this principle: "The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth" (189:2.8). Throughout Jesus's ministry: "No law of nature was modified, abrogated, or even transcended" (136:5.4). Time compressed but physical laws remained intact.

**Near-Instantaneous Dissolution**  
The accelerated conversion of Jesus's physical body to energy within a five-minute operational window.

> The description as "well-nigh instantaneous" (189:2.1) indicates measurable duration despite extreme temporal compression. Between 3:10 AM authorization and 3:15 AM completion, billions of years of natural decomposition compressed into moments through ultimaton acceleration.

---

## O

**Orders of Celestial Personalities**  
The comprehensive assembly of universe beings who participated in the resurrection events.

> The archangel chief gathered "a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities" (189:2.3). This unprecedented gathering included archangels, Master Physical Controllers, morontia auxiliary personalities, and midwayers. Each order contributed specialized capabilities to the coordinated operation.

---

## P

**Paradise Gravity**  
The absolute circular gravity circuit emanating from Paradise that controls all energy-matter throughout the master universe.

> "Ultimatons are not subject to local gravity...but they are fully obedient to absolute or Paradise gravity" (42:6.4). During dissolution, ultimatons remained responsive to Paradise gravity even while achieving partial antigravity behavior, enabling temporal acceleration without complete escape from universe systems.

**Personalized Adjuster**  
Jesus's Thought Adjuster that achieved personal status and maintained command during the tomb period.

> "Throughout the hours of this Sabbath day...the Personalized Adjuster of Jesus was in personal command of the assembled celestial hosts" (188:3.4). However, "this Personalized Adjuster had no part in the morontia resurrection" (189:0.2), remaining separate from both resurrection and dissolution processes.

**Planetary Energy Circuits**  
Established energy pathways through which power flows within and around inhabited worlds.

> Energy transmitters serve as "marvelous dispatchers of energy as it is manifested on the individual worlds" (29:4.27). These circuits received the converted energy from Jesus's dissolved body, distributing it safely throughout Urantia's energy infrastructure.

**Power Centers (Supreme)**  
Living beings who serve as intelligent energy directors throughout the organized universes.

> "The Supreme Power Centers...are intelligent, though perhaps not personal, centers and regulators of the physical-energy circuits of the grand universe" (29:2.1). While Power Centers themselves didn't participate directly in tomb operations, their subordinate Master Physical Controllers executed the dissolution.

**Primary Associators**  
Energy conservationists among the Master Physical Controllers who store and release energy as needed.

> "These interesting and invaluable entities are masterly energy conservators and custodians" (29:4.32). They "simply act by their presence...like living catalytic agents." In tomb operations, Primary Associators likely detected and preserved residual electromagnetic patterns before dissolution.

**Puissant Energy**  
The powerful-directional phase of emerging energy that precedes gravity responsiveness.

> "This is the powerful-directional, mass-movemented, mighty-tensioned, and forcible-reacting energy" (42:2.11). When ultimatons undergo deindividuation, they revert to this puissant state before secondary transmutation into circuit-compatible forms.

---

## R

**Representatives of All Orders**  
The complete spectrum of celestial beings assembled for the resurrection events.

> This phrase emphasizes the universal significance of the tomb operations, requiring capabilities from every classification of universe personality. The assembly demonstrated cosmic coordination in response to unprecedented circumstances.

**Revolutionary Velocity**  
The axial spin rate determining ultimaton behavior and energy states.

> "Ultimatons are capable of accelerating revolutionary velocity to the point of partial antigravity behavior" (42:6.3). This velocity parameter controls whether ultimatons manifest as matter, energy, or approach spiritual frequencies.

---

## S

**Secondary Dissociators**  
Master Physical Controllers with extraordinary matter-energy conversion capabilities, known as cosmic alchemists.

> "These beings of enormous antigravity endowment are the reverse workers...They are truly the alchemists of space and the wonder-workers of time" (29:4.35). During tomb operations, Secondary Dissociators facilitated ultimaton deindividuation within the temporal acceleration field.

**Semimaterial Beings**  
Entities existing between pure spirit and physical matter, capable of interacting with both realms.

> The Supreme Power Directors represent "the first recorded instance of the derivation of semimaterial progeny from true spirit ancestry" (29:0.5). Their dual nature made them uniquely qualified for operations requiring both consciousness direction and physical energy manipulation.

**Supreme Power Directors**  
Seven beings created collectively by the Seven Master Spirits who regulate physical energy throughout the grand universe.

> "The Seven Supreme Power Directors are the physical-energy regulators of the grand universe" (29:0.2). While not directly participating in tomb operations, their created subordinates—the Master Physical Controllers—executed the dissolution under established protocols.

---

## T

**Technique of Dematerialization**  
The established celestial method for instantaneous matter-to-energy conversion without temporal process.

> The archangel chief explicitly distinguished approaches: "We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization" (189:2.1). This technique bypasses natural decomposition entirely, as when Melchizedek "vanished from their sight" (93:9.1).

**(H) Temporal Acceleration Field**  
The localized spacetime distortion created when Master Physical Controllers generate collective antigravity effects through ultimaton acceleration.

> While not explicitly termed in revelation, evidence patterns indicate a bounded region where time progresses at vastly accelerated rates. The field's creation requires synchronized acceleration of countless ultimatons, generating conditions where billions of years pass internally while moments elapse externally.

**(H) Temporal Differential**  
The ratio between time passage within the acceleration field versus external spacetime.

> The evidence suggests extreme temporal compression: billions of years of natural decomposition within the five-minute operational window. Chronoldeks monitoring both timestreams would register this differential, enabling coordination between radically different temporal rates.

**(H) Temporal Void**  
The antigravity-generated region where normal spacetime constraints cease applying.

> Created when collective ultimaton antigravity fields unify through synchronized acceleration, producing conditions where time moves differently than in matter-dense regions. The void represents transformation of spacetime structure through consciousness-directed energy manipulation.

**Time-Space Distortions**  
Variations in the normal flow of time and structure of space caused by gravity or energy manipulations.

> "Time, as reckoned by Urantia standards...is a relative matter" (33:6.9). The tomb dissolution created extreme distortion through antigravity effects, compressing cosmic timescales into moments—demonstrating natural law application rather than violation.

---

## U

**Ultimatons**  
The fundamental particles of physical creation, one hundred of which comprise each electron.

> "The ultimaton, the first measurable form of energy, has Paradise as its nucleus" (42:1.2). These particles possess "three varieties of motion: mutual resistance to cosmic force, individual revolutions of antigravity potential, and the intraelectronic positions" (42:6.4). During dissolution, Master Physical Controllers accelerated ultimaton velocities toward critical escape thresholds.

**(H) Ultimatonic Frequencies**  
The vibrational rates determined by ultimaton revolutionary velocities that establish all material properties and energy states.

> While the revelation describes revolutionary velocities, the frequency concept represents analytical correlation between velocity and manifestation. Master Physical Controllers modulate these frequencies through consciousness fields, achieving material transformations through velocity adjustments.

**Ultimatonic Revolutionary Velocity**  
The axial spin rate of ultimatons that determines their energy state and gravitational response.

> "This same ultimatonic velocity of axial revolution also determines the negative or positive reactions of the several types of electronic units" (42:6.6). During dissolution, Mechanical Controllers accelerated these velocities toward critical thresholds where matter transforms to energy.

**Universe Administration**  
The hierarchical organization managing all cosmic operations from Paradise to individual worlds.

> The tomb dissolution demonstrated this administration in action: request, consultation, authorization, and execution (189:2.1-3). This sequence reveals ordered government achieving divine purposes through coordinated celestial action.

**Universe Energy (Thirty Forms)**  
The complete spectrum of force-energy manifestations throughout the cosmos.

> "The frandalanks are created in thirty divisions, one for each form of basic universe force" (29:4.37). During dissolution, all thirty forms participated—from ultimatonic frequencies through electromagnetic radiation to puissant energy.

---

## V

**(H) Velocity Thresholds**  
Critical revolutionary speeds where ultimatons transition between fundamental states—matter, energy, and approaching spirit frequencies.

> While the revelation describes "critical escape velocity" (42:6.3), the threshold concept represents analytical understanding about specific transition points. Each threshold represents a phase transition where consciousness-directed acceleration achieves state changes normally requiring cosmic forces.

---

## W

**Wonder-Workers of Time**  
Poetic designation for Secondary Dissociators emphasizing their temporal manipulation capabilities.

> "They are truly the alchemists of space and the wonder-workers of time" (29:4.35). This title captures their ability to accomplish through consciousness what normally requires cosmic timescales. During the tomb dissolution, they facilitated matter-energy conversion within compressed timeframes.
