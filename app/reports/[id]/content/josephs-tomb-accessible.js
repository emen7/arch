          <h2>Introduction: Lines of Investigation</h2>
          <p>
            "Where have you taken the Master? Where have they laid him?" Mary Magdalene,
            addressing a stranger she thought "might be the caretaker of the garden," desperately
            sought the missing body of Jesus (<PaperRef>189:4.10</PaperRef>). Her question at dawn on that resurrection
            morning invites our investigation—where exactly was this place?
          </p>
          <p>
            The <Term>Urantia</Term> Papers provide remarkably specific details about Joseph's tomb, details that,
            when carefully assembled, point toward precise geographic identification. This
            investigation follows five distinct trails of evidence through the revelatory account: the
            crucifixion route establishing our geographic baseline, the panicked flight of tomb guards
            revealing distance constraints, five women encountering fleeing soldiers at Damascus
            Gate, the temple captain's disposal of burial cloths "over a near-by cliff," and the tomb's
            precise specifications—dimensions, sealing system, garden setting, architectural
            orientation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each evidence trail narrows the possibilities. Combined, they converge on less than 0.05
            square miles of Jerusalem terrain. The <Term>Urantia</Term> Papers didn't merely describe a tomb; they
            provided forensic coordinates for those willing to carefully map the evidence.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2>Crucifixion Route and Timing</h2>
          <p>
            Just before nine o'clock on that Friday morning, Roman soldiers led Jesus from the
            praetorium toward <Term>Golgotha</Term><Citation num={1} />. The route selection tells us something important—while
            condemned criminals typically paraded through Jerusalem's longest streets for maximum
            public viewing, on this day they took "the most direct route to the Damascus gate, which
            led out of the city to the north"<Citation num={2} />.
          </p>
          <p>
            This northward procession passed through Damascus Gate and continued along the road
            leading toward Samaria. Following this road, they "soon arrived at <Term>Golgotha</Term>," Jerusalem's
            official crucifixion site<Citation num={3} />.
          </p>
          <p>
            One detail proves particularly significant: Jesus collapsed from exhaustion "shortly after
            passing through the gate"<Citation num={4} />. At this precise location outside the city walls, the soldiers
            conscripted Simon of Cyrene, who happened to be stopping there with other Cyrenians<Citation num={5} />.
            Simon carried the crossbeam the remaining distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey's timeline gives us our first measurement. Departing just before nine o'clock,
            the procession arrived at <Term>Golgotha</Term> "shortly after nine o'clock"<Citation num={6} />—less than one hour total,
            with most of the distance covered after Jesus collapsed at Damascus Gate. This places
            <Term>Golgotha</Term> north of Damascus Gate, along the northward road, within a one-hour walking
            distance.
          </p>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2>Guard Flight Pattern</h2>
          <p>
            The tomb's security arrangement involved both Roman and Jewish guards—ten soldiers
            provided by Pilate, supplemented by ten temple guards<Citation num={7} />. These professional soldiers
            maintained watch through standard military shifts until "the hour of the resurrection"<Citation num={8} />.

          <p>
            The stone-rolling operation provides our forensic anchor. Secondary midwayers received
            the assignment to roll away the tomb stones<Citation num={15} />. When the guards on duty witnessed "this
            huge stone begin to roll away from the entrance of the tomb, apparently of its own
            accord—without any visible means to account for such motion—they were seized with
            fear and panic, and they fled in haste from the scene"<Citation num={16} />.
          </p>
          <p>
            These were soldiers who had installed the sealing system themselves. They knew the
            stone's weight intimately. Their abandonment of posts after witnessing the impossible
            reveals professional recognition of something beyond explanation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Distance Calculations</h3>
          <p>
            The guards' flight time tells us the distance. Fleeing at approximately 3:10-3:15 AM, they
            reached Damascus Gate by 3:20-3:25 AM—a maximum transit of 10-15 minutes.
            Professional soldiers moving in panic would maintain 4-5 mph, yielding a maximum
            distance of 1.0-1.25 miles from tomb to gate.

          <h2>Conclusion: Geographic and Spiritual Significance</h2>
          <p>
            The forensic evidence converges on a specific location—the Garden Tomb, with its 88%
            dimensional match, proper geological features, and precise distance from Damascus Gate.
            The revelation appears to have deliberately confirmed this site through specifications
            unknown to 1890s archaeology, yet verifiable today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mary's question—"Where have they laid him?"—finds its answer through careful
            investigation. But this marks more than geographic coordinates. It identifies the precise
            location where the risen Jesus emerged from mortal constraints, where divine purpose
            operated through natural law rather than against it. The empty tomb stands as material
            proof that personality transcends death, that consciousness directs matter, that universe
            administration achieves its purposes through ordered processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The irony is profound: Mary addressed her question to one she thought was the garden's
            caretaker, not realizing she had spoken to the risen Master himself. Today, through the
            forensic reconstruction of revealed evidence, that garden can be identified—transforming
            her desperate question into a geographic fact, mystery into a mappable reality.
